# 🐚 Shell Scripting Mastery Setup

Install Dash (Debian Almquist shell) 
```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed dash
```

This is a POSIX compliant shell that aims to be as small as possible
It's also more performant than Bash for non-interactive scripts.

This is a cli tool for checking if a shell script is POSIX compliant,
and if a script contains bugs.
```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed shellcheck
```
